This is the full-scale fire test data of our paper "Full-scale experimental study on fire characteristics induced by double fire sources in a two-lane road tunnel".
including: 1.The tunnel ceiling temperature.
           2.ventilation velocity
           3.real-time HRR.
The tunnel basic information, environmental parameters and the sensors positions of the Jiangpu road tunnel are given in the paper. 
The authors welcome other researchers to use the experimental data to continue the tunnel fire research.
